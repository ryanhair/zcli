# Boolean negation flags (`--no-<flag>`) and optional-bool guardrails

Status: accepted

zcli parses a command's flags from its `Options` struct: a `bool` field is a flag
set by presence (`--verbose` → `true`). Two things about booleans were quietly
broken.

1. **`false` was unreachable for a flag.** A `bool` could only be set `true`; there
   was no way to say "off". A `bool = true` default couldn't be turned off from the
   command line at all — and worse, the option initializer hardcoded `bool → false`
   *before* reading the declared default, so `bool = true` silently initialized to
   `false`.
2. **`?bool` was a value option pretending to be a flag.** Because `isBooleanType`
   is `T == bool` (false for `?bool`), `?bool` fell through to the value path: it
   parsed as `--verbose <true|false>` and bare `--verbose` was
   `error.MissingOptionValue`. So the one type that *looks* like a three-state flag
   was the most confusing of all — `--verbose true` worked, `--verbose` didn't.

The motivating question was simply "how do I set `verbose: ?bool` to `false`?" — and
the honest answer was a mess.

## Decision

**Treat `bool` and `?bool` as the same thing — a boolean *flag* — and give every
boolean flag an auto-generated `--no-<flag>` negation.**

- `--flag` sets `true`; the auto-generated `--no-flag` sets `false`; an absent flag
  keeps its default (`false`, a declared `true`, or `null` for `?bool`). `?bool`
  becomes a genuine three-state flag: absent → `null`, `--flag` → `true`,
  `--no-flag` → `false`.
- Negation is **long-form only** (`--no-flag`); short flags have no negation.
  `--no-flag=value` is rejected like `--flag=value`. Negation is built from the
  option's *effective* name, so it respects a custom `meta.options.<field>.name`.
- Help shows a boolean by its **useful spelling**: a default-`false` flag lists
  `--flag`, and a default-`true` flag lists `--no-flag` (long-form only — turning it
  off is the only meaningful action, and re-asserting the default is not). The other
  spelling is accepted but hidden. Generated shell completions currently list the
  positive form only. Negation is synthesized in the parser and never materialized as
  a struct field; help derives the default-`true` case from the neutral
  `FieldInfo.type_name` + `FieldInfo.default_value` descriptors (a bool whose rendered
  default is `"true"`), not a bespoke presentation flag.
- **A boolean may appear at most once.** Repeating it — `--flag --flag`,
  `--no-flag --no-flag`, or the contradictory `--flag --no-flag` (which share the
  field's occurrence count) — is `OptionDuplicate`. There is no meaningful reason to
  pass a boolean twice, and the contradiction should fail loudly rather than
  silently last-win. Value options and accumulating arrays are unchanged.

**Two compile-time guards keep this coherent:**

- **A boolean field's effective flag name may not start with `no-`.** A `no_verbose`
  flag would collide with (and read as) some other flag's `--no-` negation. The
  positively-named alternative is always available: `color: bool = true` + `--no-color`.
- **An optional field (`?T`, any T) must default to `null`.** The initializer sets
  optionals to `null` *before* reading any default, so a non-null default was
  silently discarded. `null` is the "not passed" state that config/env fill in; a
  guaranteed value belongs on a non-optional field with a default.

## Consequences

- **This is a behavior change, not just an addition.** `?bool` stops being a value
  option: `--verbose true` no longer consumes `true` (it becomes a positional).
  `bool = true` defaults now actually hold. Per project policy (cleanest choice, no
  backwards-compatibility shims) this is the intended trade.
- The mechanism is one predicate, `isBooleanFlag(T) == (T == bool or T == ?bool)`,
  replacing the nine `T == bool` flag-vs-value decision sites in the parser and
  classifier. The initializer and env-fallback paths keep `== bool` (a `?bool`
  initializes to `null`, and env values apply to the unwrapped child).
- `--no-color` — a near-universal flag — is now expressed as `color: bool = true`
  and disabled with the auto-generated `--no-color`, rather than a hand-rolled
  `no_color: bool` (which the first guard now forbids).
- `OptionDuplicate` existed in the error set and diagnostics all along but was never
  emitted; it is now wired up for booleans.

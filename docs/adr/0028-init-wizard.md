# The `zcli init` wizard

Status: proposed

`zcli init` is the first thing every user (human or agent) touches, and today it
stops at the project skeleton: name/semver validation, a plugin multi-select,
AGENTS.md, `zig fetch --save`, and next-steps text. Everything *around* the
skeleton — git, a first build, README, GitHub wiring, plugin configuration — is
left for the user to discover. This ADR defines the full init experience:
everything a user might reasonably want decided up front, gathered in one short
wizard, with complete flag parity for non-interactive use.

## Goals

1. **The happy path is ~5 keystrokes.** A short wizard, not an interrogation.
   Every step has a sensible default and can be skipped.
2. **The first manual command runs the user's CLI, not the compiler.** init
   verifies its own output (`zig fetch` + `zig build`) so a scaffold bug is our
   failure, surfaced immediately, not the user's confusing first experience.
3. **Agents are first-class** (ADR-0001..0008). Hard invariant: **every prompt
   has a flag, and `--defaults` (or a non-TTY stdin) answers all of them.**
4. **No dead ends in generated code.** A selected plugin with required config
   gets a follow-up prompt (with a smart default), not a `TODO:` placeholder.

## The wizard flow

Each numbered step is one prompt (or zero, when the corresponding flag was
passed). Order matters: identity → shape → plugins → extras → confirm → do.

1. **Name** — positional arg, as today (`.` = current dir). Unchanged
   validation (identifier-safe, no leading digit, no Zig keywords).
2. **Description** — prompt when interactive and `--description` absent.
   A one-line prompt beats an eternal "A CLI application built with zcli"
   in every `--help` render. Default: skip with the generic text.
3. **CLI shape** — select, `--template <multi|single>`:
   - `multi` (default): current scaffold — `src/commands/hello.zig`, groups
     grow from there.
   - `single`: the root **is** the command (rg/fd style) — scaffold a
     top-level `src/commands/index.zig` with Args/Options and no subcommand
     example. Restructuring between shapes later is genuinely annoying, which
     is why this is asked up front. (A kitchen-sink demo template can be
     added later; out of scope.)

   **Prerequisite**: ADR-0029 (first-class single-command CLIs — the root is
   a group, executable root `index.zig`, positional fallback routing,
   `root.zig` removed). The `single` template ships only after ADR-0029
   lands.
4. **Plugins** — multi-select, as today; flag: `--plugins help,version,...`
   (`--plugins none` for none). New behavior: a selected plugin whose config
   has required fields gets a follow-up prompt instead of TODO placeholders.
   Today that's only `github_upgrade` → prompt for `OWNER/REPO`, default
   inferred from `git remote get-url origin` when available. Non-interactive
   with no flag value: keep the compiling TODO snippet (current behavior).
5. **Extras** — multi-select, flags `--git/--no-git`, `--github <ci,release>`:
   - **git** (default on): `git init`, Zig `.gitignore` (`.zig-cache/`,
     `zig-out/`), initial commit after a successful scaffold. Skip silently
     when `git` is absent or the directory is already inside a work tree.
   - **GitHub CI workflow** (default off): build + test on push/PR. Net-new
     scaffold (nothing exists under `gh add workflow` for CI yet); implement
     as `zcli gh add workflow ci` first, then reuse from init.
   - **GitHub release workflow** (default off, but **suggested on** when
     `github_upgrade` was selected — the release workflow completes the
     self-update loop): reuse the existing `gh add workflow release` scaffold.
6. **Summary + confirm** — one themed block ("Creating `my-app`: multi-command
   · plugins: help, version, not_found · git · release workflow — proceed?")
   before anything touches disk. `--yes` (or `--defaults`, or non-TTY) skips.
7. **Scaffold + verify** — write files, `zig fetch --save` (spinner), `zig
   build` (spinner; `--no-build` opts out), git commit, themed success box
   whose next step is `./zig-out/bin/<name> hello World` (already built).

New scaffold content regardless of choices: **README.md** stub (name,
description, build/run/test instructions).

## Flag surface (the agent contract)

```
zcli init <name|.>
  --description <text>        --app-version <semver>
  --template <multi|single>   --plugins <list|none>
  --upgrade-repo <owner/repo> (github_upgrade config)
  --git | --no-git            --github <ci,release|none>
  --no-build                  --yes / --defaults
  --dry-run                   (print the file list + summary, write nothing)
```

Rules: any flag answers its prompt; `--defaults` answers every remaining prompt
with its default; non-TTY stdin implies `--defaults`; `--yes` additionally
skips the confirm. `--dry-run` renders the summary and file list and exits 0.

## Failure behavior

Unchanged where it exists today (validate before writing; delete the created
tree on scaffold failure; fetch failure downgrades the success message with the
exact recovery command). New steps follow the same pattern: a `zig build` or
`git` failure after a good scaffold is a **warning with the exact command to
run**, never a rollback — the project is valid, only the verification step
failed.

## Deliberately deferred

- Homebrew/package-manager distribution scaffolding — premature.
- Remote or user-definable templates — wait for demand.
- Editor config (`.vscode/`, zls) — opinionated, low value.
- License/author prompts — revisit when release artifacts need them.
- Config-file scaffolding for `zcli_config` — the plugin works without one.

## Implementation increments

Each lands independently, in this order:

1. **Flag parity + `--defaults`/`--yes`/`--dry-run`** for the existing surface
   (plugins flag, non-TTY = defaults formalized). Pure additive; unblocks agents
   immediately.
2. **Git + README + `zig build` verification** with spinners and the summary/
   confirm step. The bulk of the perceived-quality win.
3. **`--template single`** (top-level `src/commands/index.zig` scaffold) and
   the shape prompt — blocked on ADR-0029 landing first.
4. **Plugin config prompt-through** (`github_upgrade` repo, `--upgrade-repo`,
   git-remote default).
5. **`zcli gh add workflow ci`**, then the extras step reusing both gh
   scaffolds from init.

Every increment keeps `zig build e2e` green and adds e2e coverage for its
non-interactive path (the interactive paths are covered by the existing
prompt/vterm harness).

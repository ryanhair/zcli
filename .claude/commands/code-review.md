I want you to carefuly go through the latest changes in this codebase and code review it (use Git to get a diff, as well as all added and removed files). We wrote a _lot_ of code together, really quickly, and I want to make sure that it's clean, well-organized, and following Zig, and general programming, best practices. Don the hat of a senior Zig engineer, and carefully review all of our code, and come up with a list of anything that we need to improve across the codebase.
